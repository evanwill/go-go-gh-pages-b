{% include figure.html img="octojekyll.png" alt="Octojekyll logo" width="40%" %}

With [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) you can quickly create and publish a website for free! 
It is an ideal solution for creating a simple project, open educational resource, or personal site to highlight your academic work. 
Because hosting through gh-pages is free and builds valuable transferable skills, this is a great option for teaching and learning.

This workshop will introduce using free hosting from GitHub Pages integrated with the popular static website generator Jekyll. 
Along the way we will cover the basics of GitHub, HTML, Markdown, and Jekyll. 
You will learn how to set up a project repository, write content in Markdown, and publish your site, all using GitHubâ€™s user friendly web interface. 
More advanced usage of Jekyll for local web development is introduced final section.

Each section of the workshop has a video embedded on the page (shot in Nov 2020).
